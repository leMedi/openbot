# Issue Tracker: GitHub

- Create: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- Read: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- List: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments`
- Comment: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- Label: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`

## Pull Requests As A Triage Surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

GitHub shares one number space across issues and pull requests. Resolve an ambiguous number with `gh pr view <number>` and fall back to `gh issue view <number>`.

## Skill Operations

- "Publish to the issue tracker" means create a GitHub issue.
- "Fetch the relevant ticket" means run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.
